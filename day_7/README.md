# I was impatient to get to Unit 9

So I skipped the challenges & lessons of Units 7 & 8.
They were mostly just getting acquainted with more sensors on the vex robots.

While the eyes/color sensors & magent are neat, I wanna write algorithms!
(Also, there was a lot of emphasis on nesting `for` and `while` loops. I'll stick
to making use of higher order functions instead for my iterations.)
